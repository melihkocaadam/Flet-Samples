# Flet-Utils (Flutils)
**Link to Online Demo [here](https://flutils.pages.dev/)!**

When developing with Flet([website](https://flet.dev), [gitHub](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet)), It's not that easy to work with classes that take alot of parameters. 
Choosing the perfect values for the Padding, Alignment, Border Radius... of our Controls becomes very difficult, time-consuming and/or very annoying. 

I then decided to build this tool - Flet Utils - to help out all those using Flet to build applications, to efficiently and rapidly choose parameters when working with Controls.
